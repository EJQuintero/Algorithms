'''Write an algorithm that depicts the Fibonacci Series as efficiently as possible, with the least amount of code lines possible.'''

# define a function so the algorithm will be easily called at any number of interest
def FebFun(var):
    # The first two numbers in the series are required to begin the process.
    F = [0, 1]
    # Each additional number in the series is calculated by adding the two previous numbers.
    for i in range(2,var):
        F.append(F[-1] + F[-2])
    # print results. If our only number of interest is the one used to call the series, then we only print F[-1].
    print(F)
